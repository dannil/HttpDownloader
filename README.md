# HttpDownloader

A server application for automating downloads.

## Install

Because this application is in very early development, no generic installer exists. Clone the repository, configure your own database with the attached SQL-statements present inside the resources-folder, and connect the application to it by changing the file persistence.xml found inside the folder META-INF with your own credentials.
