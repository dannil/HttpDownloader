# HttpDownloader

A server application for automating downloads.

## Install

Because this application is in very early development, no generic installer exists. The minimum required steps to try out the application is listed below.

1. Clone the repository from the master branch if you'd like the stable version (or if you're brave and want the bleeding edge, clone the dev branch). 
2. Configure your own database with the attached SQL-statements present inside the resources-folder.
3. Connect the application to the database by changing the file persistence.xml found inside the folder META-INF with your own credentials.
